# Lessons Learned for TagMap

This document captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence for the TagMap application. It serves as a living document that evolves as development progresses.

## Development Patterns

### Architecture Patterns

- Client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API design following resource-oriented principles
- Component-based frontend with Vue.js
- Geospatial data handling with GeoDjango and PostGIS

### Code Organization

- Django models organized by functional domain (authentication, plans, etc.)
- Vue components follow feature-based organization
- Reusable components kept separate from page-specific components

## Technical Insights

### GeoDjango & PostGIS

- Use spatial indexing for query performance
- Store geometry data in appropriate format (Point, LineString, Polygon)
- Use proper SRID for accurate calculations
- Consider performance implications of complex spatial queries

### Leaflet Integration

- Use custom controls for better user experience
- Implement layer groups for organized map layers
- Optimize rendering for mobile devices
- Consider memory usage when handling large datasets

## User Experience Preferences

- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes
- Clear visual hierarchy of interface elements
- Intuitive map controls with minimal learning curve
- Consistent visual language throughout the application

## Project Management Insights

- Documentation-first approach to ensure clarity and alignment
- Test-driven development for critical components
- Feature-based organization of tasks
- Phased development approach

## UI Improvements

- Replaced default Note tool icon with map pin SVG to better represent geolocation and improve UX
- Enhanced Note icon with a circle underneath to create a drop pin effect, improving visual metaphor and recognition
- Improved visibility of the drop pin shadow with increased size and subtle fill for better distinction

This document will be updated continuously as development progresses and new insights are gained.
